Description: This function corrects the bias in estimated regression coefficients due to classical additive measurement error (i.e., within-person variation) in logistic regressions under the main study/external reliability study design and the main study/internal reliability study design. The output includes the naive and corrected estimators for the regression coefficients; for the variance estimates of the corrected estimators, the extra variation due to estimating the parameters in the measurement error model is ignored or taken into account.
